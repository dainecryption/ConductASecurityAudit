<h1>Conduct a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<i>*This scenario is based on a fictional company.</i>

Botium Toys, a small U.S.-based business with a physical storefront and warehouse, has seen its online presence grow, attracting customers domestically and internationally. As the demand increases, the company's IT department faces heightened pressure to support its expanding online market. Concerned about compliance and maintaining smooth operations during this growth, the IT manager has decided to conduct an internal IT audit to better secure the company's infrastructure and manage potential risks.

The IT manager is particularly focused on complying with regulations related to online payments and business operations in the European Union. To address these challenges, she has begun implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), outlining the audit's scope and goals, identifying managed assets, and conducting a risk assessment. The audit's primary aim is to evaluate the risks and potential fines associated with the current state of the company's security posture, ensuring compliance and safeguarding business operations as Botium Toys continues to expand.

My task is to review the IT managerâ€™s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a [controls and compliance checklist.](https://github.com/dainecryption/SecurityAudit/blob/main/Controls%20and%20Compliance%20Checklist.pdf)
